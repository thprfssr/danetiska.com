# Danetian New Year

Today we celebrate the Danetian New Year 3351. This festival marks the start of
the year according to the [Danetian Calendar](calendar.html), and is tied to
the new moon closest to the vernal equinox.

For Danetians, the New Year Festival is a time of new beginnings; a chance to
set positive goals for oneself, and to strive to fulfill them.

In the coming months, the Danetian Academy will intensify its work in
cultivating and promoting the Danetian language, calendar, and culture, to
breathe life into a tradition that never was.

Happy New Year! Prinom Jerom!
