<h1 id="the-danetian-calendar">The Danetian calendar</h1>
<p>The Danetian calendar is a lunisolar calendar used by the Danetian
people. Each month starts and ends at roughly the new moon.</p>
<p>The synodic period of the Moon is around 29.530 588 days. Therefore,
the months of the calendar alternate between 29 and 30 days in order to
keep them in sync with the phases of the Moon. If a month has 29 days,
it’s called a hollow month; if it has 30, it’s called a full month.</p>
<p>Grouping months into years presents a challenge: If a year is defined
to be 12 months, that results in 354 days, which is too short. If we
instead define a year as 13 months, the result is roughly 383 days,
which is too long. To get around this, some years are set to have 12
months, while others have 13, so that the average year length ends up
being around 365.2421 days. Essentially, an entire leap month is
inserted every two or three years in order to keep the calendar in sync
with the seasons.</p>
<h2 id="month-names">Month names</h2>
<p>The twelve months are named according to a modified version of the
Chinese zodiac: 1. Rat 2. Ox 3. Wolf (Tiger in the Chinese zodiac) 4.
Rabbit 5. Eagle (Dragon in the Chinese zodiac) 6. Snake 7. Horse 8. Goat
9. Hedgehog (Monkey in the Chinese zodiac) 10. Rooster 11. Dog 12. Pig
13. Epagomenal (only in leap years)</p>
<p>The Danetians use these month names because they lived alongside
Turkic tribes for several centuries. It was common for these Turkic
tribes to use a modified version of the Chinese zodiac, with some
animals replaced by local fauna.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-rules-for-months">Mathematical rules for
months</h2>
<p>Months alternate between full (30 days) and hollow (29 days) in a
specified pattern in order to keep the average month length equal to
29.530 588 days. By writing this number as a continued fraction, we can
see that two rational approximants arise: 1447/49 and 25 101/850. That
is to say, we can approximate the synodic period of the Moon by
arranging 1447 days into 49 months, or 25 101 days into 850 months for
an even better approximation.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, certain months are recognized as
“metallic months”. These are always full months, and are characterized
by the “metallic month festivals”: the Iron Month Festival, the Silver
Month Festival, and the Golden Month Festival. Certain rules are in
place: 1. After a hollow month always comes a full month, and
vice-versa. 2. After counting 17 months, the next month is recognized as
an iron month. Iron months are always full months, superseding rule #1.
3. After counting 49 months, the next month is recognized as a silver
month. Silver months are always full months, superseding rule #1.
Moreover, they reset the iron month count, superseding rule #2. 4. After
counting 850 months, the next month is recognized as a golden month.
Golden months are always full months, superseding rule #1. Moreover,
they reset both the iron month count and the silver month count, thereby
superseding rules #2 and #3.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-rules-for-years">Mathematical rules for years</h2>
<p>Years can either be short (12 months) or long (13 months; also called
leap years). The average length of the month is 25 101/850 = 29.530 588.
Thus, in order to remain in step with the tropical year of 365.2421
days, the most appropriate rational approximants to use are 235/19 and
4131/334.</p>
<p>The fraction 235/19 represents the Metonic cycle, which was already
known in antiquity; it arranges 235 months into 19 years.</p>
<p>The calendar uses a system similar to that of metallic months,
celebrating the Silver Year Festival and the Golden Year Festival. The
following rules are in place: 1. Within a cycle of 19 years, the
following years are leap years: #2, #5, #7, #10, #13, #15, #18. 2. After
counting 19 years, the next year is known as a silver year, and it marks
the beginning of a new Metonic cycle. 3. After counting 334 years, the
next year is known as a golden year. This resets the silver year count,
superseding rule #2.</p>
<h2 id="sexagenary-cycle">Sexagenary cycle</h2>
<p>Another tradition inherited from the Chinese calendar is the
sexagenary cycle. The twelve animals of the zodiac are combined with the
five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, water) in order to give a cycle
of 60 years: 1. wood rat 2. wood ox 3. fire wolf 4. fire rabbit 5. earth
eagle 6. earth snake 7. metal horse 8. metal goat 9. water hedgehog 10.
water rooster 11. wood dog 12. wood pig 13. fire rat 14. fire ox 15.
earth wolf 16. earth rabbit 17. …</p>
<p>The current sexagenary cycle began in the year 3310, or 1984 in our
calendar.</p>
