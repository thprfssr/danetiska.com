/s/ may occur at the beginning before another syllable, as in *stistami*
"I stand". Actual syllables are frequently simpler than the maximal template.

syllable. The location of the stress may seem unpredictable at first, but there
are general rules that it tends to follow. For example, in one class of words,
stress shifts between the stem and the ending in different case forms.
