After the Russo-Turkish War, the great powers of Europe met in the
[Congress of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Berlin)
in 1878 to carve out new countries from the territory of the
Ottoman Empire. Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro all gained independence, and
Bulgaria's borders were shrunk from what the
[Treaty of San Stefano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_San_Stefano)
gave them.
And in this crowded chessboard, the great powers debated the fate of
[Dobrudja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobruja).

The Danetians were a distinct people that inhabited Dorbudja, a strategically
important land situated at the mouth of the Danube. At the Congress of Berlin,
the question was not whether the Danetians should be free, but how they could
exist without upsetting the balance of power.

Russia wanted more influence in the Danube. Bulgaria coveted the land of
Dobrudja. Romania, fresh from gaining independence, saw Dobrudja as rightful
compensation for their sacrifices. But none of the great powers wanted any one
neighbor to dominate the lower Danube.

Thus, a compromise was hatched: Danetia would be recognized as an independent
principality that would be perpetually neutral. This meant that Danetia could
govern itself and fly its own flag, but it was forbidden from joining any
military alliances or hosting foreign garrisons. Its independence and neutrality
were backed by the great powers of Europe.

This compromise suited them all.
Bulgaria and Romania were kept apart. Russia could still take back
[Southern Bessarabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Bessarabia),
ensuring its access to the Danube. And Britain and
Austria-Hungary checked Russian expansion by creating a neutral buffer state
at the mouth of the Danube.

On 14 July 1878, or 15 Cancer 3204 in the lunar calendar, the Danetian National
Assembly gathered in the capital to affix its seal to the treaty. Bells rang
in every church, and the Danetian flag was raised for the first time. That
night, under a full moon, the people celebrated their freedom.
