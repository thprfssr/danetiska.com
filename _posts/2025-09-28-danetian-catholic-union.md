When the Danetians originally settled in the land of
[Dobrudja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobruja), they converted to
Orthodox Christianity, thereby securing an alliance with the Byzantine empire.

However, by the early 15th century, the Byzantine empire was in steep decline.
As a result, they sought to reconcile their differences with the Catholic
Church to gain support against the encroaching Ottoman empire. This culminated
in the
[Bull of Union with the Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_of_Union_with_the_Greeks),
issued by Pope Eugenius IV during the
[Council of Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Florence)
in 1439. Being under Byzantine jurisdiction, the Danetians therefore entered into
communion with Rome.

When this union with Rome was rejected by the Orthodox laity a few years later,
the Danetian church decided to remain loyal to Rome. As a result, Pope Sixtus IV
issued the following decree in 1476, confirming the fidelity of the Danetians.

## Decretus pro Danetis
 
Sixtus, Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God,
for perpetual memory.
 
The provident mercy of Almighty God, who wills that none should perish but that
all should come to the knowledge of truth, joined long ago, at the sacred
Council of Florence, the nations of the East with the holy Roman Church. Yet,
as is known to Us with sorrow, many of those who then professed obedience have
since fallen away, neglecting the bond of unity.
 
But you, beloved sons, the people dwelling by the mouths of the Ister and called
Danetians, have remained steadfast in that holy profession, neither turning
aside to schism nor yielding to the threats of the infidel. Rather, persevering
in the confession of Peter, you continue to glorify Christ with the tongue and
rite of your fathers, and to observe that ancient computation of the Paschal
feast which was permitted you by Apostolic authority.

Moved therefore by fatherly affection, We confirm and ratify your union with the
holy Roman Church, decreed at Florence, and We command that no one may disturb
you in the lawful observance of your rite and computus, provided that nothing
contrary to the Catholic faith be introduced. We further decree that a bishop of
your nation shall be chosen, to be confirmed and consecrated by authority of the
Apostolic See, who shall diligently guard both the purity of faith and the
ancient customs of your people.

Let no man infringe this Our confirmation or rashly oppose it. If anyone should
presume to do so, let him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty
God and of His blessed Apostles Peter and Paul.
 
Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's, in the year of the Lord 1476, the sixth year of
Our Pontificate.
 
Sixtus PP. IV
