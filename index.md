# The Danetian Language

Danetian is an artifially constructed
[Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages)
language. It was
created by applying a series of regular sound changes to
[Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language).
The result of this process is a naturalistic
[conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)
with a rich inflectional morphology, and a healthy dose of
irregular forms.

The Danetian people, much like their
[Indo-European ancestors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Europeans),
were horse nomads roaming the Eurasian steppe. They originally settled around
[Lake Baikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal)
and the
[Yenisei River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yenisey)
in modern-day Russia. However, due to
a series of military conflicts with neighboring Turkic tribes, they were
forced to migrate westward around the year 1100 CE. After an arduous
journey characterized by more military conflicts, they eventually
settled in the coastal plains of modern-day Romania and Bulgaria, in a
region called
[Dobrudja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobruja).

The core vocabulary of Danetian is inherited from
Proto-Indo-European. However, since the Danetian people were in contact
with neighboring Turkic tribes for several centuries, the language has
borrowed many words from the Turkic languages; these are mainly military
words, and words relating to the nomadic way of life. Danetian has also
borrowed extensively from Latin and Greek.

Since the inception of this project in 2016, the language
has undergone a myriad of revisions and rewritings. This site is
intended to be a living and ever-changing reference document that
describes the current state of the language.

[lunisolar calendar](/calendar.html)
used by the Danetians.

	

## The North Wind and the Sun

#### Danetiska:

Seminopts i Suls ambidisjnunto peri yosio po est kratuyos, yoda
pontoyonts opibemt vestiostos en bermi faracji. Sjomuksanto peri yosio
pramos viknunts dekni apokapieni pontoyonts faracjim, iti vopomnos
kratuye uper alii.

Seminopts blest posme kratue yosme mokst, nu polue blet, polue
tankte plesjet pontoyonts faracjim peri sve. Tarmeni, Seminopts prodot
udmoktim. Toda, Suls berme lukeyostet, da immediate djastre
apokapiostet pontoyonts faracjim.

Da tosmad, Seminopts dolgostet udvepni yod Suls est kratuyos esj
dvomos.

#### Angliska:

The North Wind and the Sun were arguing over who was stronger, when
a traveller came dressed in a warm coat. They agreed that the first to
succeed in making the traveller take off his coat would be called
stronger than the other.

The North Wind blew as strongly as he could, but the more he blew,
the more tightly did the traveller wrap his coat around himself. In the
end, the North Wind gave up the effort. Then, the Sun shone warmly, and
immediately the traveller took off his coat.

Because of this, the North Wind had to admit that the Sun was the
stronger of the two.



## The Sheep and the Horses

#### Danetiska:

Ovis, yosmoi valna ne est, vidst esjvons: oinom dukontam brauvom
vodjom, aliom berontam masjlom borom, i tritom berontam virom pluktie
djastre. Ovis disjt esjvomos: «Moyom sjerd me payeti, vindontam virom
dukontam esjvons». Esjvoi disjent: «Sjlu, Ovi! Nosja sjerda nos
payonti, vindontans sjod: Viros, potis, dekti valnam esj ovies en
bermom vestrom pro sve. Da oviei valna ne esti». Sjod sjesjlukvos, ovis
en asjdrom bugostet.

#### Angliska:

A sheep that had no wool saw some horses: one pulling a heavy wagon,
another carrying a big load, and a third one carrying a man quickly. The
sheep said to the horses, "My heart pains me, seeing a man driving
horses." The horses said, "Listen, sheep! Our hearts pain us, seeing
this: A man, the master, makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment
for himself. And the sheep has no wool." Having heard this, the sheep
fled into the field.



## Our Father

#### Danetiska:

Pater Nosje, Yo esi en diusu,

Sjventeyosteto noman Tvoyom,

Opibamiet resjman Tvoyom,

Masjito velia Tvoya i en diuvi i ana djami,

Sjdranom nosjom anasontiom do ansmos sjadinam,

Da apoyek ansmos dolgons nosjons

Yosme vi apoyakmos dolgetormos nosjomos,

Da ne nos endukies en perietim,

Nu esjpasnu nos apo dusmenesos.

#### Angliska:

Our Father, Who art in the heavens,

Hallowed be Thy name,

Thy kingdom come,

Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven,

Give us this day our daily bread,

And forgive us our debts

As we forgive our debtors,

And lead us not into temptation,

But deliver us from the evil one.



## Thrice Holy

#### Danetiska:

Sjvente Dive, Sjvente Maktie, Sjvente Desjmerti, mileyoste nos.

#### Angliska:

Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.
