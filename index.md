# {{ page.title }}

The Danetian Academy is dedicated to preserving and promoting the Danetian
language and culture, as well as other fields of knowledge, such as history,
literature, science, and philosophy. It was founded on the idea that a people's
language and memory are inseparable from their pursuit of knowledge.
Danetia's heritage can only thrive when placed in dialogue with the broader
world of human thought. The Academy publishes dictionaries, essays, critical
studies, and creative works to share the Danetian heritage with the world.



## The Danetian Language

Danetian is an artificially constructed
[Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages)
language. It was
created by applying a series of regular sound changes to
[Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language).
The result of this process is a naturalistic
[conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)
with a rich inflectional morphology, and a healthy dose of
irregular forms.

The Danetian people, much like their
[Indo-European ancestors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Europeans),
were horse nomads roaming the Eurasian steppe. They originally settled around
[Lake Baikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal)
and the
[Yenisei River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yenisey)
in modern-day Russia. However, due to
a series of military conflicts with neighboring Turkic tribes, they were
forced to migrate westward in the eighth century CE. After an arduous
journey characterized by more military conflicts, they eventually
settled in the coastal plains of modern-day Romania and Bulgaria, in a
region called
[Dobrudja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobruja).

The core vocabulary of Danetian is inherited from
Proto-Indo-European. However, since the Danetian people were in contact
with neighboring Turkic tribes for several centuries, the language has
borrowed many words from the Turkic languages; these are mainly military
words, and words relating to the nomadic way of life. Danetian has also
borrowed extensively from Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Persian.

Since the inception of this project in 2016, the language
has undergone a myriad of revisions and rewritings. This site is
intended to be a living and ever-changing reference document that
describes the current state of the language.
