<h1 id="the-danetian-language">The Danetian Language</h1>
<p>Danetian is an artifially constructed <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages">Indo-European</a>
language. It was created by applying a series of regular sound changes
to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language">Proto-Indo-European</a>.
The result of this process is a naturalistic <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">conlang</a>
with a rich inflectional morphology, and a healthy dose of irregular
forms.</p>
<p>The Danetian people, much like their <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Europeans">Indo-European
ancestors</a>, were horse nomads roaming the Eurasian steppe. They
originally settled around <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal">Lake Baikal</a> and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yenisey">Yenisei River</a> in
modern-day Russia. However, due to a series of military conflicts with
neighboring Turkic tribes, they were forced to migrate westward in the
eighth century CE. After an arduous journey characterized by more
military conflicts, they eventually settled in the coastal plains of
modern-day Romania and Bulgaria, in a region called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobruja">Dobrudja</a>.</p>
<p>The core vocabulary of Danetian is inherited from
Proto-Indo-European. However, since the Danetian people were in contact
with neighboring Turkic tribes for several centuries, the language has
borrowed many words from the Turkic languages; these are mainly military
words, and words relating to the nomadic way of life. Danetian has also
borrowed extensively from Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Persian.</p>
<p>Since the inception of this project in 2016, the language has
undergone a myriad of revisions and rewritings. This site is intended to
be a living and ever-changing reference document that describes the
current state of the language.</p>
