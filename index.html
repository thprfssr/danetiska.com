	<h1>The Danetian Language</h1>

	<p>Danetian is an artificially constructed Indo-European language that
	forms its own branch within the larger Indo-European family. It is
	characterized by a highly inflectional morphology, which means that the
	endings of words change depending on their function in a sentence. This
	inflection allows for a wide range of grammatical distinctions,
	including categories such as case, number, gender, tense, aspect, mood,
	and voice. Nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs all have different
	endings that indicate these distinctions. In addition to inflecting for
	these categories, adjectives in Danetian must agree with the gender,
	case, and number of the nouns they modify, while verbs must agree in
	person and number with their subjects.</p>

	<p>The writing system of Danetian is based on the standard Latin
	alphabet, with a handful of digraphs to represent sounds that are not
	found in Latin. The language has a rich vocabulary and a complex
	grammar, which includes both regular and irregular forms.</p>

	<p>Danetian was created by starting from the reconstructed words in
	Proto-Indo-European and applying a series of regular sound changes.
	Much of the complexity of Proto-Indo-European grammar is preserved in
	Danetian, which makes it a naturalistic language that looks and feels
	like it could be a real-world language spoken somewhere in Europe. I
	have taken great care to preserve a healthy amount of irregularities in
	the grammar, as is common in any real-world language.</p>

	<p>Since the inception of this project in 2016, the grammar of Danetian
	has undergone a myriad of revisions and rewritings. This site is
	intended to be a living and ever-changing reference document that
	describes the current state of the language. It is written for readers
	who are already familiar with technical grammatical terminology, and are
	interested in seeing what a modernized and evolved version of
	Proto-Indo-European would look like.</p>

	<h2>The North Wind and the Sun</h2>

	<h4>Danetiska:</h4>

	<p>Seminopts i Suls ambidisjnunto peri yosio po est kratuyos, yoda
	pontoyonts opibemt vestiostos en bermi faracji. Sjomuksanto peri yosio
	pramos viknunts dekni apokapieni pontoyonts faracjim, iti vopomnos
	kratuye uper alii.</p>

	<p>Seminopts blest posme kratue yosme mokst, nu polue blet, polue
	tankte plesjet pontoyonts faracjim peri sve. Tarmeni, Seminopts prodot
	udmoktim. Toda, Suls berme lukeyostet, da immediate djastre
	apokapiostet pontoyonts faracjim.</p>

	<p>Da tosmad, Seminopts dolgostet udvepni yod Suls est kratuyos esj
	dvomos.</p>

	<h4>Angliska:</h4>

	<p>The North Wind and the Sun were arguing over who was stronger, when
	a traveller came dressed in a warm coat. They agreed that the first to
	succeed in making the traveller take off his coat would be called
	stronger than the other.</p>

	<p>The North Wind blew as strongly as he could, but the more he blew,
	the more tightly did the traveller wrap his coat around himself. In the
	end, the North Wind gave up the effort. Then, the Sun shone warmly, and
	immediately the traveller took off his coat.</p>

	<p>Because of this, the North Wind had to admit that the Sun was the
	stronger of the two.</p>



	<h2>The Sheep and the Horses</h2>

	<h4>Danetiska:</h4>

	<p>Ovis, yosmoi valna ne est, vidst esjvons: oinom dukontam brauvom
	vodjom, aliom berontam masjlom borom, i tritom berontam virom pluktie
	djastre. Ovis disjt esjvomos: «Moyom sjerd me payeti, vindontam virom
	dukontam esjvons». Esjvoi disjent: «Sjlu, Ovi! Nosja sjerda nos
	payonti, vindontans sjod: Viros, potis, dekti valnam esj ovies en
	bermom vestrom pro sve. Da oviei valna ne esti». Sjod sjesjlukvos, ovis
	en asjdrom bugostet.</p>

	<h4>Angliska:</h4>

	<p>A sheep that had no wool saw some horses: one pulling a heavy wagon,
	another carrying a big load, and a third one carrying a man quickly. The
	sheep said to the horses, "My heart pains me, seeing a man driving
	horses." The horses said, "Listen, sheep! Our hearts pain us, seeing
	this: A man, the master, makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment
	for himself. And the sheep has no wool." Having heard this, the sheep
	fled into the field.</p>



	<h2>Our Father</h2>

	<h4>Danetiska:</h4>

	<p>Pater Nosje, Yo esi en diusu,
	<br>Sjventeyosteto noman Tvoyom,
	<br>Opibamiet resjman Tvoyom,
	<br>Masjito velia Tvoya i en diuvi i ana djami,
	<br>Sjdranom nosjom anasontiom do ansmos sjadinam,
	<br>Da apoyek ansmos dolgons nosjons
	<br>Yosme vi apoyakmos dolgotormos nosjomos,
	<br>Da ne nos endukies en perietim,
	<br>Nu esjpasnu nos apo dusmenesos.</p>

	<h4>Angliska:</h4>

	<p>Our Father, Who art in the heavens,
	<br>Hallowed be Thy name,
	<br>Thy kingdom come,
	<br>Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven,
	<br>Give us this day our daily bread,
	<br>And forgive us our debts
	<br>As we forgive our debtors,
	<br>And lead us not into temptation,
	<br>But deliver us from the evil one.</p>



	<h2>Thrice Holy</h2>

	<h4>Danetiska:</h4>

	<p>Sjvente Dive, Sjvente Maktie, Sjvente Desjmerti, mileyoste nos.</p>

	<h4>Angliska:</h4>

	<p>Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.</p>
