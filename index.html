	<h2>The North Wind and the Sun</h2>
	<p>The North Wind and the Sun were arguing over who was stronger, when
	a traveller came dressed in a warm coat. They agreed that the first to
	succeed in making the traveller take off his coat would be called
	stronger than the other.</p>
	<p>The North Wind blew as strongly as he could, but the more he blew,
	the more tightly did the traveller wrap his coat around himself. In the
	end, the North Wind gave up the effort. Then, the Sun shone warmly, and
	immediately the traveller took off his coat.</p>
	<p>Because of this, the North Wind had to admit that the Sun was the
	stronger of the two.</p>
